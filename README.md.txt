# 📂 Linux Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of hands-on projects focused on Linux System Administration, Networking, Automation, and DevOps fundamentals.  These Projects are more focused on HOW-Tos rather than WHAT's in it. 
Each project includes documentation, screenshots, and working configurations. If Documentation followed, its easier to do daily boring tasks and reference it later. This project will continue to have new projects as I keep uploading them.
